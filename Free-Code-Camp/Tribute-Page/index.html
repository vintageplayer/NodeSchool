      </div>
      <p> Prithvi was born to rajput king of Ajmer, Someshwar Chauhan in the year 1165 AD. He grew up to be a great warrior who was also affectionate towards people from all walks of life. He was a true rajput, possesing qualities such as humility, humbleness, bravery and forgiving nature. He believed in fighting fair, a belief which led to his demise and that of Hindu rule in Delhi.</p>
      <p>Prithvi Raj took Ajmer throne at the mere age of 13 years after his father's death. By then his tales of bravery and figthing skills had been heard far and wide. He had mastered the skill of shabd-bedi-band (Shooting an arrow using a voice source as target) at a very young age. Prithvi raj always managed to defeat his opponents. </p>
      <p>Hearing about the young king's achievements, he was declared the heir to the throne of Delhi by his maternal grandfather Anangpal of Tomar Dynasty, the current king of Delhi. He fought many battles and ended up conquering all nearby kingdoms. </p>
      <p>As it is with fame, Prithvi's rise to power was envied by great many kings. After being declared as the heir to the throne of Delhi, Prithvi's cousin, King Jaichand of Kannauj had developed strong feelings of hatred toward Prithvi. Despite being much older than Prithvi, he was not the one to get the throne. This led to a strong enemity between the two kings, later ensuring each-other's demise.</p>
      <p>Strong feelings of hatred of Jaichand's was not shared by his daughter, Sanyogita. A deep love developed between Prithvi and her, which is still know as very great love story. After discovering this, Jaichand decided to host a swayamwar for his daughter, inviting kings from all places. King Prithvi was not included, instead an idol of his was kept at the enterence inorder to disrespect her. Yet, when Sanyogita had to choose her groom, she placed a garland on the idol, behind which the actual Prithvi Raj Chauhan was disguised as a security guard. He then abducted her from the palace and married her.</p>
      <p>Prithvi Raj Chauhan was repeatedly challenged by foreign invader Shahabuddin Muhammad Ghori. He was defeated 16 times, but Prithvi Raj, being the humble king, let him free. The 17th time he attacked, he attacked before dawn, which was rest time in Rajput rule. Prithvi was captured and taken to Afganistan. There he was insulted and his eyes were gouged out using hot iron rods.</p>
      <p>The brave king endured all tortures, without ever bowing down to is emprisoner, waiting for the day he could get his revenge. He boasted to Ghouri about his skill to shoot an arrow using shabd-bedi-bandh technique. Curious about this skill, Ghori gave permission for a demonstration. Astonished and impressed by the show, Ghori couldn't help but praise the great king. Hearing Ghori's voice, Prithvi took his aim, and shot the Mughal invader dead. Even in imprisonment, he defeated his enemy.</p>
